		<h2> Let's take our time tonight, girl
		<h2> Above us all the stars are watchin' </h2>
		<h2> There's no place I'd rather be in this world </h2>
		<h2> Your eyes are where I'm lost in </h2>
		<h2> Underneath the chandelier </h2>
		<h2> We're dancin' all alone </h2>
		<h2> There's no reason to hide </h2>
		<h2> What we're feelin' inside </h2>
		<h2> Right now </h2>
		<h2> So baby let's just turn down the lights </h2>
		<h2> And close the door </h2>
		<h2> Oooh I love that dress </h2>
		<h2> But you won't need it anymore </h2>
		<h2> No you won't need it no more </h2>
		<h2> Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby </h2>
		<h2> Versace on the floor </h2>
		<h2> Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl </h2>
		<h2> Versace on the floor </h2>
		<h2> Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl </h2>
		<h2> I unzip the back to watch it fall </h2>
		<h2> While I kiss your neck and shoulders </h2>
		<h2> No don't be afraid to show it off</h2>
		<h2> I'll be right here ready to hold you</h2>
		<h2> Girl you know you're perfect from</h2>
		<h2> Your head down to your heels</h2>
		<h2>Don't be confused by my smile</h2>
		<h2>'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real</h2>
		<h2>So just turn down the lights</h2>
		<h2>And close the door</h2>
		<h2>Oooh I love that dress</h2>
		<h2>But you won't need it anymore</h2>
		<h2>No you won't need it no more</h2>
		<h2>Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby</h2>
		<h2>Versace on the floor</h2>
		<h2>Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl</h2>
		<h2>Versace on the floor</h2>
		<h2>Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl</h2>
		<h2>Dancev
		<h2>It's warmin' up, Can you feel it?</h2>
		<h2>It's warmin' up, Can you feel it?</h2>
		<h2> It's warmin' up, Can you feel it, baby?</h2>
		<h2>It's warmin' up</h2>
		<h2>Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more</h2>
		<h2>Let's just kiss 'til we're naked</h2>
